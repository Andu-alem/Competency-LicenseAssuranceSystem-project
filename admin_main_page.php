	<p> The SNNPR Communication Information Technology Agency is one of the regional ICT Agency in 
	Ethiopia. It is governmental organization established in …….. <br> It has got a responsibility of managing, 
	regulating, developing, investigating, securing and performing any ICT related activities in the region 
	under the scope and collaboration with <br> Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. It has 
	four case teams: Network, Software and Website development, Data center and Maintenance, and 
	Research and Training. <br>
	SNNPR CITA has a responsibility to collect information on how many competencies had given in ICT 
	sector and in which category is it given, and report it back to MCIT. <br> The way they gather this information 
	has been done manually. This method takes much of their precious things like:- time and cost.
	So in order to overcome this problem we develop a web based system. <br> This system have many advantage 
	over existing system in different ways some of this are: - it reduce the work load of employee and 
	authorized person, it saves many and it take small time to complete the service. <br> In this system the 
	competentees are registered whenever the competency is issued. So whenever the competency is issued 
	authenticated users can see online (an updated information)
